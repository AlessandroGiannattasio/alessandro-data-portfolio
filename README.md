# Retail Sales Analytics (SQL Project)

## Goal
Simulate a real business analysis using SQL to explore sales performance by product category, customer, region, and over time.

## Data
Three related tables: `customers`, `products`, `orders` (CSV included).

## What I built
- Relational schema (3 tables)
- Reusable SQL queries for sales analytics
- KPI summary for dashboards

## Key queries
- Total sales by category
- Top customers by revenue
- Sales by region
- Monthly sales trend

## Skills
`SQL` · `Data Modeling` `Business Analytics` · `Critical Thinking`

## How to run
1. Create the three tables from `queries/schema.sql`
2. Import CSVs from `dataset/`
3. Execute `basic_queries.sql` then `intermediate_queries.sql`
